7/14/20 - initial coding
7/16/20 - switched to OOP for sanity. the code will be cleaner this way. now have objects that do different things like
          will make an object for each window I create, and will store all of the reusable data in one huge object.
7/19/20 - login logic and UI done for the most part. can connect to server and get all of the data. then import it into
          the data object. UI for linked clones done. switched to dictionaries for the data storage instead of lists.
          this should make life easier when it comes to retrieving that data. Linked clone logic written
7/20/20 - Moving functions to universal file. This will improve code re-usability. Going to rewrite Linked clone object
          to be more general so that it can be used for several different functions. Before the next major round of
          coding will go through code and do more type hinting and docstrings to make sure program is more readable.
7/25/20 - Going to implement Instant clone and Disk promotion. Will reuse CloneWin class for this with a few small
          modifications. Future versions may include options for multiple clones and the ability to create a cloned lab.
          Also during testing with type hints, I realized that they are not always useful. Sometimes they get in the
          way of working code. So while I will use them wherever possible, their usage is not an absolute. Furthermore
          methods that call other objects in the module AND call functions in Vulcan must be kept at the class method
          level since moving them to Vulcan causes circular import issues.
8/3/20 -  Fixed an error with DataTree where the DVPortgroup objects were being recognized as a object of type Network.
          This was likely due to it being a child object of Network. This also eliminated the need for getting another
          view object from the server so that was removed. Starting work on cloning DVPortgroups. Will reuse the
          PromoteDisk object for the window. There is nothing in the vCenter API to directly clone a DVPortgroup so that
          will have to ne a reworking of creating a new portgroup taking most of the configuration from the master
          portgroup.
8/10/20 - Decoupled connection window from rootwindow class to allow for better code reuse. Added random six digit
          number to the end of linked clones and instant clones to avoid name collision errors. Also fixed a bug in
          instant clone function.
